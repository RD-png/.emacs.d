* CURRENTLY WORKING ON
** FESP POWER BI
*** TODO From the reportDashboardData function assign the data to the relevant graph

*** REVIEW Consider changing how requests are fired off, seems there is some conflicts with computed properties that will cause performance issues, may be better to directly set the store from the MultiSelect components. As would reduce the amount of data that is being passed between files.

*** REVIEW Store a list of all possible fields that could be in the selects and filter via javascript, this would make far more sense than constantly sending requests to the back end. This will not work for skus as we need to break down atts for each skus to filter them, this will have to use an api call.

*** REVIEW Currently there are too many watchers and computeds which are hard to keep track of when there is so many reactive/ref properties involved.

*** DONE Store the selected parameters for products/skus/sources etc in the store

* STOCK CONTROL
