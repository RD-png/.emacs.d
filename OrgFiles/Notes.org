Change the order of the select filters to sources -> suppliers -> categories -> products -> skus

Remove saved skus if the sku doenst exist for it

Cats cant overwrite the supplier

# when we have things selected in a select and they get filtered based on values selected in another select, we keep the selected options if they exist in the filtered list, ok. If we then deselect the filter we had that filtered the original select, do we reselect the ones we had originally, or do we just keep the ones that survived the filtering, the first solution would require more work that possibly worth for this kind of edge case.

When the page is first loaded and all the values are set as selected by default this breaks the filtering a little bit where, even if the the products select gets filtered it doesnt remove them because of how the conditions in the if statements. I can still insert all values into store as default, but this can cause issues with the way they show as selected and deselected, as if i do that with current setup they would show as deselected but the value would be in the store.

Could do with removing the double call on watchers / computeds but not sure how the watcher is getting called 2 times, might be able to use a watchEffect instead to avoid multiple calls which causes slight lag.
