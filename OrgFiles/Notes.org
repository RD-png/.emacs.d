1. Do some comparisons of the set 12 months and the rolling 12 months and ensure they make sense

2. Put the rolling predictions into the the main stockPredictions method, or maybe have it in a seperate method depending on how slow it is to load the additional data

3. Begin adding the new ebay source into the ebay request, check the data that is returned form the order matches the same format as the other sources.

4. Change the csv based methods for ebay request to use the seller hub format since ebay are removing the file exchange
