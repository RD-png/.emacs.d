* TODO Create user groups to restrict non admin users from being able to create source / couriers etc, they should only be able to create orders

* TODO Create table for key, barcode pair, with auto increment id, id is reset on empty table, for key types, can grab the items from cache, avoid having to store any information for items within the ecs database

* TODO Finish the script to pull the old records into the new database, we need to sort a fixed list of sources, couriers, reasons, channels etc before we can insert this data, we can use test ones for one

* DONE Extend the basic functionality of the views for the order app, serializers seem to be confliciting when trying to return one field

* TODO On fesp orders page, chage the href url to use the new tripler system, pass the orderid and source in the url, so we know which database to query, rather than looping through them all

* TODO Ensure that the order forms are only acessible from redirect from the fesp orders page.

* TODO Finish up the forms for each type of order, the Return is nearly complete, since the others are pretty simple in structure they shouldnt take too long

* DONE Alias the foreign key relationships for cleaner url arguments ? Might have to declare a custom filterset to handle the foreign notation '__', Could also use related_name as people claim this allows you to express relationships between tables without using the foreign key prefix

* TODO Start Hermes section of ecs after finishing forms
