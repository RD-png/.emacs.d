#+title: Returns

** What fields do we actually need from the current database

We have reason_returned, reason_courier , reason_customer, action_product, action_customer, reason

These are all very similar ?

Merge reason_returned, reason_courier, reason_customer into a shared field across all types of orders which we will store in the Reasons model.

When a user is creating a return, they will select a reason from a drop down and that will then provide them with a list of valid options for the type of reason they have selected

For return orders we need some additional information to be stored, we need to have the action_product and action_customer stored.

These will have no dependency on other tables

Note: need to add these ass new tables, since they are sepperate

the reason field seems redundant and can be grouped with notes


Reason_Options:

This way we can query via reason_id to get a list of possible options

| reason_id | option_id |
|-----------+-----------|
|         1 |         5 |
|         1 |         4 |
