#+title: Return-Form

Need to seperate the options so that they are categorized by reason, eg they will have types that they can belong to.

structure database so that:
-> Reason holds reason for order
-> Reason_Option holds option for the reason
Note: When the user selects a reason in the form this will filter the available Reason_Options

-> Product_Option Will be a new table, that doesnt have a Reason related to it, just indicates what actions were taken on the products

need to add an additional column in the reasons table, which stores the option for the customer

Might need to inlude a seperate table


Make join table for many to many reasons -> options
