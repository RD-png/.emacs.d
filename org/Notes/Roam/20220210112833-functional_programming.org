#+title: Functional-Programming

* Functional
What does functional mean. It can be interpreted in several ways, however the following two statements summarize the main themes of functional programming languages.

+ Functions are first class, they are treated and can be used the same as any other value.
+ Evaluation a functional program can be viewed as the evaluating expressions rather than instructions.


* Pure
While not all functional programming languages are purely functional, most generally contain the following concepts.

** Referentially Transparent
+ No mutation of any sort, whether this state within the scope of a function or global state.
+ No side effects, no mutation of global state, no printing etc.
+ Deterministic, functions produce the same results given one input.
