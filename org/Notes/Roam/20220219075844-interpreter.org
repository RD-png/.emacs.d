#+title: Interpreter

* Purpose of an Interpreter ?
** Parsing
Takes some inputs in the form of a sequence of characters, syntacticly valid and then translate the input into an internal representation. In a simple interpreter the internal representation is usually a abstract syntax tree that closes resembles the nested structure of statements and expressions in the program. This abstract syntax tree is input into a compiler which then produces a set of instructions that the computer can execute.

** Execution
The abstract syntax tree is then processed according to the semantic rules of the language, thereby carrying out the computation.
